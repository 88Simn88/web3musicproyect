# 🎧 SynthFlow

**SynthFlow** is a decentralized music platform that connects artists and fans through blockchain technology.  
It’s similar to Spotify, but with real rewards and tokenized interactions.

## 🚀 About the Project

SynthFlow was inspired by the idea of giving artists fair compensation and fans meaningful participation.  
Built as a Web3 experiment in the intersection of music and blockchain, SynthFlow allows listeners to discover music, support creators directly, and earn rewards based on engagement.

### What inspired me
As a pianist and composer, I’ve seen how streaming platforms often undervalue creators.  
I wanted to explore how decentralization could help musicians thrive while keeping fans actively involved.

### What I learned
- Integrating blockchain wallets with Web apps (Ready, Braavos, etc.)
- Handling token rewards and off-chain points
- Designing modern UI with React + Tailwind
- Structuring a scalable DApp architecture
